We follow the feature branch strategy, utilizing development, main, feature, hotfix, and release branches to streamline the reliable software delivery process and promote code to the production environment.

The development branch is the central hub where active development takes place. Developers create feature branches from this branch to work on new features or bug fixes, ensuring each new feature is developed in its own isolated branch. Once a feature is complete, it undergoes peer reviews before merging back into the development branch.

When a feature is finalized and thoroughly tested in the development environment, it is merged into the main branch via a pull request. After merging into the main branch, the code is automatically deployed to the QA environment, where extensive testingâ€”including performance, smoke, security, and integration testsâ€”is performed to ensure quality and stability.

Upon successful QA validation, the code is tagged as a release version and promoted to the production environment. Post-production deployment, continuous monitoring is conducted to track application behavior and performance. If bugs are detected in production, a hotfix branch is created immediately from the main branch to address the issue. After resolving the issue, the hotfix is merged back into both the main and development branches to maintain branch consistency.

This branching strategy ensures a consistent and reliable process for promoting code from development to production environments.

**Q. How do developers work on new features or bug fixes using feature branches?**

Developers follow a structured feature branch workflow to work on new features or bug fixes, ensuring a smooth integration process into the main codebase.

Developers pull the latest code from the development branch to ensure they are working with the most up-to-date version. 

git checkout development
git pull origin development

Create a new feature branch from the development branch

git checkout -b feature/new-feature-name

Developers write code, make changes, and test locally.
After implementing the required changes, they stage and commit them

git add .
git commit -m "Implemented new feature XYZ"

Push the feature branch to the remote repository

git push origin feature/new-feature-name

Once development is complete, a Pull Request (PR) is raised to merge the feature branch into the development branch.
The PR undergoes code reviews, where peers and senior developers provide feedback.
If necessary, changes are made, and the PR is updated accordingly

After approval, the feature branch is merged into development

git checkout development
git merge feature/new-feature-name
git push origin development

The feature branch can be deleted after merging

git branch -d feature/new-feature-name
git push origin --delete feature/new-feature-name

The merged code is automatically tested in the QA environment using CI/CD pipelines.
If all tests pass, the feature is included in a release branch and promoted to production.

**Q. What steps are taken before a feature branch is merged back into the development branch?**

Before merging, the feature branch must be synchronized with the latest changes in the development branch to prevent conflicts.

git checkout development
git pull origin development  # Ensure the latest code is fetched
git checkout feature/feature-name
git merge development  # Merge latest changes into the feature branch.

This minimizes merge conflicts and ensures the feature is built on the latest development code.

A Pull Request (PR) is raised to merge the feature branch into the development branch.
Team members review the code for:
âœ… Code quality and best practices
âœ… Security vulnerabilities
âœ… Performance issues
âœ… Adherence to business logic and requirements

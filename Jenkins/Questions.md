Q. what is Poll SCM in Jenkins?
***********************************
In Jenkins, Poll SCM means that Jenkins periodically checks the version control system (VCS) for any changes. When changes are detected, it triggers a build automatically. This feature allows you to schedule how often Jenkins checks for updates, making it an integral part of continuous integration (CI) processes. By configuring Poll SCM, you can ensure that your codebase is frequently checked for updates, leading to timely builds, automated responses to code changes, and seamless integration with scheduled tasks.

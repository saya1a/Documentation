Q. what is the difference between ADD and COPY in Dokcerfile?

The Docker ADD command is a powerful tool that allows you to copy files from a specific URL into your Docker image. For instance, if you need to retrieve a log file from an AWS S3 storage, download a Java-related file, or fetch any text file directly from GitHub, you can utilize the ADD command. This command simplifies the process of downloading files from the internet, as you only need to provide the URL, and Docker will handle the download for you. A practical example could be retrieving a log file from an S3 bucket or downloading a specific package using wget or curl. By using the ADD command, the URL will be fetched, and the file will be downloaded automatically into your Docker image.

In contrast, the Docker COPY command is specifically designed to copy files from your local filesystem into the Docker image. This command is useful when you want to include source code, configuration files, or any other files from your laptop or EC2 instance directly into the container. For instance, if you need to copy your application's source code from your development machine into the Docker container, you would use the COPY command.

To summarize:

ADD Command: Ideal for downloading files from URLs and adding them to your Docker image.

COPY Command: Used to copy files from your local filesystem into the Docker image.

Q. What are the types of different networking in docker? and what is the default network in Docker? 
**************************************************************************************************
Docker provides several networking types to connect containers to each other and to the external network. The default networking type in Docker is the Bridge network. Here are the main types of networking available in Docker:

Bridge Network:

This is the default network type. It creates a private internal network on the host, where containers connected to the bridge network can communicate with each other. Containers on this network can also access the external network through the host.

Host Network:

In this mode, a container shares the host's network stack. The container uses the same network interface and IP address as the host. This is useful when you need high performance and minimal network latency, but it eliminates network isolation between the host and the container.

Overlay Network:

The overlay network is used for multi-host networking and is especially useful for Docker Swarm or Kubernetes environments. It allows containers running on different Docker hosts to communicate securely. This network type creates a distributed network across multiple Docker daemons.

MacVLAN Network:

This mode allows a container to appear as a physical device on the network by assigning it a unique MAC address. The container behaves as if it is a separate physical host on the network, which is beneficial for legacy applications that require direct layer 2 network access.

None Network:

The none network type disables networking for the container. It provides no network access and isolates the container from any networks.

Default Networking in Docker:
The default network type in Docker is the Bridge network. When you create a container without specifying a network, Docker connects the container to the bridge network automatically. This network is created using a virtual Ethernet bridge called docker0, and it allows containers to communicate with each other and with the host network.

These networking options provide flexibility for different use cases, ranging from simple container-to-container communication to complex multi-host networking solutions.

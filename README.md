Q. what is the difference between ADD and COPY in Dokcerfile?
The Docker ADD command is a powerful tool that allows you to copy files from a specific URL into your Docker image. For instance, if you need to retrieve a log file from an AWS S3 storage, download a Java-related file, or fetch any text file directly from GitHub, you can utilize the ADD command. This command simplifies the process of downloading files from the internet, as you only need to provide the URL, and Docker will handle the download for you. A practical example could be retrieving a log file from an S3 bucket or downloading a specific package using wget or curl. By using the ADD command, the URL will be fetched, and the file will be downloaded automatically into your Docker image.

In contrast, the Docker COPY command is specifically designed to copy files from your local filesystem into the Docker image. This command is useful when you want to include source code, configuration files, or any other files from your laptop or EC2 instance directly into the container. For instance, if you need to copy your application's source code from your development machine into the Docker container, you would use the COPY command.

To summarize:

ADD Command: Ideal for downloading files from URLs and adding them to your Docker image.

COPY Command: Used to copy files from your local filesystem into the Docker image.
